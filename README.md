# Tindog - Scrimba Module 7 Solo Project: Next Level JS 

## About The Project

This solo project represents the final project in this module. The aim was to follow a Figma design spec and to use JavaScript classes and modules to create a dog 'dating site'. The specified flow starts with a profile being displayed, with a cross icon and a heart icon. The icons should 'glow' on hover. When clicking on an icon either the 'like' or 'nope' badge should appear on top of the image. After a short while the profile should be removed and a new profile displayed.  The decision should also be made as to what should happen when the the user has reached the end of the “deck” (aka the array of dogs).

An array of three dog objects was provided in the data.js file. The index.html, index.css, Dog.js and index.js were build from scratch unaided.

Other techniques employed in creating the site include:

- The ternary operator
- Object.assign()
- object destructuring
- disabling and enabling buttons
- setTimeout()
- creating an array of 'liked' dogs and using a for loop to display them in a list using conventional English syntax using commas and 'and' appropriately

Index.css file updated on 30 December to add aspect-ratio property to .dog-container. This was done to improve the user experience, and as a Scrimba Module 8 exercise to practise branching and pull requests.
